- QXlsx is excel file(*.xlsx) reader/writer library.
- Because QtXlsx is no longer supported(2014), I created a new project that is based on QtXlsx. (2017-)
- Development language of QXlsx is C++. (with Qt)
- You don't need to use static library or dynamic shared object using QXlsx.

## :page_with_curl: How to use
- See [examples](Example.md)
	- HelloWorld : Hello world example (the most basic structure)

	- You don't need to use static library or dynamic shared object using QXlsx.
